The Reporter app is the **read-only insights arm** of the 10x pipeline. It pinpoints high-cost app/infra events **before** forwarders ship them to log analyzers, enabling storage and licensing **cost optimization**.

**Deployment**: a DaemonSet alongside your forwarder — *not* a sidecar injected into it, and *not* a cloud app polling your SIEM's REST API. The reporter tails the same event stream your forwarder sees (pre-SIEM), publishes cost insight metrics, and fails independently: if the reporter goes down, your logs continue flowing to the SIEM uninterrupted.

Not in the critical log path. No mutation of existing fluent-bit / fluentd / otel-collector configs. Similar deployment pattern to `datadog-agent` or `splunk-otel-collector`.

## :material-clipboard-play-outline: Setup Guide

Follow the steps below. Steps that require customization link to the relevant [Config Files](#config-files) section where you can edit on github.dev or locally.

???+ tenx-bootstrap "Step 1: Install"

    Install the `Edge` or `JIT-Edge` binary flavor on the same machine as your log forwarder:

    - :simple-linux: [Single line script](https://doc.log10x.com/install/singleline/ "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/log-10x/pipeline-releases/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --flavor edge"){data-copy="curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/log-10x/pipeline-releases/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --flavor edge"} | [DEB](https://doc.log10x.com/install/linux/#ubuntu-debian) | [RPM](https://doc.log10x.com/install/linux/#red-hat-centos-7)
    - :simple-macos: [Homebrew](https://doc.log10x.com/install/macos/ "brew install log-10x/tap/log10x"){data-copy="brew install log-10x/tap/log10x"}
    - :material-microsoft-windows: [PowerShell script](https://doc.log10x.com/install/win/)
    - :simple-docker: [Docker image](https://doc.log10x.com/install/docker/)

??? tenx-config "Step 2: Set Environment Variables"

    Set these environment variables before running. See [path configuration](https://doc.log10x.com/install/paths/) for details.

    | Variable | Description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | `TENX_MODULES` | Path to your [modules directory](https://doc.log10x.com/install/paths/#modules) |
    | `TENX_CONFIG` | Path to your [configuration directory](https://doc.log10x.com/install/paths/#config) |
    | `TENX_API_KEY` | Your Log10x API key ([get one](https://doc.log10x.com/run/bootstrap/#apikey)) |

    ```bash
    export TENX_MODULES=/etc/tenx/modules
    export TENX_CONFIG=/etc/tenx/config
    export TENX_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

    See [best practices](https://doc.log10x.com/engine/gitops/#best-practices) for managing secrets in production.

??? tenx-forwarderinputs "Step 3: Configure Your Forwarder"

    === ":simple-fluentd: Fluentd"

        **Step 1**: Include the 10x reporter configuration:

        ```toml title="my-fluentd.conf"
        @include "#{ENV['TENX_MODULES']}/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/fluentd/conf/tenx-report.conf"
        ```

        **Step 2**: Use a `copy` directive to report on events while still sending them to output:

        ```xml title="my-fluentd.conf"
        <source>
          @type tail
          path /path/to/file.log
          tag my_logs
        </source>

        <match my_logs>
          @type copy

          # Write to output (e.g. Elastic, Splunk)
          <store>
            @type stdout
          </store>

          # Report to 10x
          <store>
            @type relabel
            @label @TENX
          </store>
        </match>
        ```

        !!! note
            For large files or volume surges, set [XMX](https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-parameters#explicit-heap-memory---xms-and-xmx-options) or use [read_bytes_limit_per_second](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail#read_bytes_limit_per_second).

    === ":simple-fluentbit: Fluent-bit"

        **Step 1**: Include the 10x reporter configuration:

        ```toml title="my-fluent-bit.conf"
        # Nix
        @INCLUDE /etc/tenx/config/pipelines/run/modules/forwarder/fluentbit/conf/tenx-report.conf

        # Windows
        # @INCLUDE c:/program files/tenx-edge/config/pipelines/run/modules/forwarder/fluentbit/conf/tenx-report.conf
        ```

        **Step 2**: The Lua filter catches all events by default. To report on a subset, update the `Match` field:

        ```toml title="tenx-report.conf"
        [FILTER]
            Name Lua
            Match *
            script ${TENX_MODULES}/${tenx_lua}
            call tenx_process
        ```

    === ":simple-beats: Filebeat"

        Add the reporter processor script to your configuration:

        ```yaml title="my-filebeat.yml"
        filebeat.inputs:
          - type: filestream
            id: my-filestream-id
            paths:
              - /path/to/log

            processors:
              - script:
                  lang: javascript
                  file: ${TENX_MODULES}/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/filebeat/script/tenx-report.js
        ```

    === ":simple-logstash: Logstash"

        Add a `pipe` output to delegate events to the reporter:

        ```ruby title="my-logstash.conf"
        output {
          pipe {
            id => "tenx_pipeline"
            ttl => -1

            # Nix
            command => "${TENX_BIN:/opt/tenx-edge/bin/tenx} run @run/input/forwarder/logstash/report/config.yaml @apps/reporter"

            # Windows
            # command => "${TENX_BIN:'c:\\program files\\tenx\\tenx-edge.exe'} run @run/input/forwarder/logstash/report/config.yaml @apps/reporter"
          }
        }
        ```

    === ":simple-opentelemetry: OTel Collector"

        !!! note "Requires otel-collector-contrib"
            The OpenTelemetry Collector integration requires the **contrib** distribution for `syslogexporter` support.

        **Step 1**: Copy the OTel Collector configuration:

        ```bash
        cp $TENX_MODULES/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/otel-collector/report/tenxNix.yaml /etc/otelcol-contrib/
        ```

        **Step 2**: Update the configuration to match your log sources:

        ```yaml title="report/tenxNix.yaml"
        receivers:
          filelog:
            include:
              - /var/log/**/*.log  # Customize paths
            start_at: end
        ```

        **Step 3**: Configure your final exporters (Elastic, Splunk, etc.) in the same pipeline:

        ```yaml title="report/tenxNix.yaml"
        service:
          pipelines:
            logs:
              receivers: [filelog, otlp]
              processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
              exporters: [syslog/tenx, elasticsearch]  # Add your exporters
        ```

        Reporter mode is **read-only** - logs flow to Log10x for analytics AND to your final destinations in parallel.

    === ":simple-splunk: Splunk UF"

        !!! note "File Relay Pattern"
            This integration uses a **file relay pattern**: Fluent Bit + 10x reads from Folder A, reports on events, and writes to Folder B. Splunk UF monitors Folder B and handles forwarding to Splunk indexers. Events are unchanged - 10x only observes and reports metrics.

        **Step 1**: Set up folder paths:

        ```bash
        export FOLDER_A=/var/log/app        # App writes here
        export FOLDER_B=/var/log/processed  # UF reads from here
        mkdir -p ${FOLDER_B}
        ```

        **Step 2**: Configure Fluent Bit to read from Folder A, report, and write to Folder B:

        ```toml title="fluent-bit-splunk.conf"
        [SERVICE]
            Flush        1
            Log_Level    info

        [INPUT]
            Name         tail
            Path         ${FOLDER_A}/*.log
            Tag          app.logs

        # Include 10x reporter - sends events to 10x subprocess
        @INCLUDE ${TENX_MODULES}/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/fluentbit/conf/tenx-report.conf

        # Include Unix socket - receives processed events back from 10x
        @INCLUDE ${TENX_MODULES}/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/fluentbit/conf/tenx-unix.conf

        # Write events (unchanged) to Folder B
        [OUTPUT]
            Name         file
            Match        *
            Path         ${FOLDER_B}
            Format       plain
        ```

        **Step 3**: Configure Splunk UF to monitor Folder B:

        ```ini title="inputs.conf"
        [monitor://${FOLDER_B}]
        index = main
        sourcetype = app_logs
        ```

        This keeps Splunk UF as the forwarder (handling buffering, retries, timeouts) while 10x reports on events inline. See the [Splunk UF module](https://doc.log10x.com/run/input/forwarder/splunkUF/) for details.

    === ":simple-datadog: Datadog Agent"

        !!! note "File Relay Pattern"
            This integration uses a **file relay pattern**: Fluent Bit + 10x reads from Folder A, reports on events, and writes to Folder B. Datadog Agent monitors Folder B and handles forwarding to Datadog. Events are unchanged - 10x only observes and reports metrics.

        **Step 1**: Set up folder paths:

        ```bash
        export FOLDER_A=/var/log/app        # App writes here
        export FOLDER_B=/var/log/processed  # DD Agent reads from here
        mkdir -p ${FOLDER_B}
        ```

        **Step 2**: Configure Fluent Bit to read from Folder A, report, and write to Folder B:

        ```toml title="fluent-bit-datadog.conf"
        [SERVICE]
            Flush        1
            Log_Level    info

        [INPUT]
            Name         tail
            Path         ${FOLDER_A}/*.log
            Tag          app.logs

        # Include 10x reporter - sends events to 10x subprocess
        @INCLUDE ${TENX_MODULES}/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/fluentbit/conf/tenx-report.conf

        # Include Unix socket - receives processed events back from 10x
        @INCLUDE ${TENX_MODULES}/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/fluentbit/conf/tenx-unix.conf

        # Write events (unchanged) to Folder B
        [OUTPUT]
            Name         file
            Match        *
            Path         ${FOLDER_B}
            Format       plain
        ```

        **Step 3**: Configure Datadog Agent to monitor Folder B:

        ```yaml title="conf.d/tenx.d/conf.yaml"
        logs:
          - type: file
            path: ${FOLDER_B}/*.log
            service: myapp
            source: myapp
        ```

        This keeps Datadog Agent as the forwarder (handling buffering, retries, metadata enrichment) while 10x reports on events inline. See the [Datadog Agent module](https://doc.log10x.com/run/input/forwarder/datadogAgent/) for details.

    === ":material-test-tube: Test (no forwarder)"

        Test the reporter without setting up a forwarder using the [Dev CLI](https://doc.log10x.com/apps/dev/).

        The dev app uses the [file input module](https://doc.log10x.com/run/input/file/) to read sample log files and generates cost analytics reports, allowing you to verify reporting behavior before integrating with your forwarder.

        **No forwarder configuration required** - provide sample log files to the file input module and skip to [Step 7](#__tabbed_6_5) to run the test.

??? tenx-symbols "Step 4: Symbol Library (optional)"

    Load custom [Symbol library](https://doc.log10x.com/compile/) files to transform events into typed TenXObjects.

    Place symbol files in the `symbolPaths` folders specified in the [symbol config](#symbols).

??? tenx-initializers "Step 5: Enrichments (optional)"

    Enrichments add context (severity, HTTP codes) for richer aggregation reports.

    **To enable:**

    1. In the [app config](#mainConfig), uncomment the desired enrichment `include` entries
    2. In the [initializers](#initializers) section below, configure each enrichment's settings

??? tenx-metricoutputs "Step 6: Metrics Output (optional)"

    Publish [aggregated](https://doc.log10x.com/run/aggregate/) metrics to time-series databases (Prometheus, Datadog).

    **To enable:**

    1. In the [app config](#mainConfig), uncomment the desired metric output `include` entry
    2. In the [metric outputs](#metricOutputs) section below, configure connection details

??? tenx-mainconfig "Step 7: Run"

    Start your forwarder with the updated configuration:

    === ":simple-fluentd: Fluentd"

        ```console
        $ fluentd -c my-fluentd.conf
        ```

    === ":simple-fluentbit: Fluent-bit"

        ```console
        $ fluent-bit -c my-fluent-bit.conf
        ```

    === ":simple-beats: Filebeat"

        ```console title="Nix/OSX"
        $ filebeat -c my-filebeat.yml -e 2>&1 | /opt/tenx-edge/bin/tenx run @run/input/forwarder/filebeat/report/config.yaml @apps/reporter
        ```

        ```console title="Windows"
        $ filebeat -c my-filebeat.yml -e 2>&1 | "c:\program files\tenx-edge\tenx" run @run/input/forwarder/filebeat/report/config.yaml @apps/reporter
        ```

    === ":simple-logstash: Logstash"

        ```console
        $ logstash -f my-logstash.conf
        ```

    === ":simple-opentelemetry: OTel Collector"

        **Step 1**: Start Log10x Reporter first:

        ```console
        $ tenx run @run/input/forwarder/otel-collector/report @apps/reporter
        ```

        **Step 2**: Start OTel Collector with the 10x configuration:

        ```console
        $ otelcol-contrib --config=/etc/otelcol-contrib/report/tenxNix.yaml
        ```

    === ":simple-splunk: Splunk UF"

        **Step 1**: Start Fluent Bit with the 10x reporter:

        ```console
        $ fluent-bit -c fluent-bit-splunk.conf
        ```

        **Step 2**: Start (or restart) Splunk UF to pick up Folder B:

        ```console
        $ splunk restart
        ```

        Fluent Bit + 10x will read from Folder A, report on events (without modification), and write to Folder B. Splunk UF monitors Folder B and forwards to indexers.

    === ":simple-datadog: Datadog Agent"

        **Step 1**: Start Fluent Bit with the 10x reporter:

        ```console
        $ fluent-bit -c fluent-bit-datadog.conf
        ```

        **Step 2**: Start (or restart) the Datadog Agent to pick up Folder B:

        ```console
        $ sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent
        ```

        Fluent Bit + 10x will read from Folder A, report on events (without modification), and write to Folder B. Datadog Agent monitors Folder B and forwards to Datadog.

    === ":material-test-tube: Test (no forwarder)"

        Use the [Dev CLI](https://doc.log10x.com/apps/dev/) to test event processing with sample log files.

        **Step 1**: Provide sample log files to the [file input module](https://doc.log10x.com/run/input/file/):

        ```console
        $ cp /path/to/sample.log $TENX_CONFIG/data/sample/input/
        ```

        **Step 2**: Run the dev app:

        ```console
        $ tenx run @apps/dev
        ```

        The dev app reads events from `data/sample/input/*.log` via the file input module and generates cost analytics reports without needing a forwarder.

        **View results in the dashboard** after running to verify reporting works correctly.

??? tenx-checklist "Step 8: Verify"

    Verify no errors appear in the [log file](https://doc.log10x.com/manage/logging/#log-file-location). For debugging techniques including enabling verbose logging, see [Engine Logging](https://doc.log10x.com/manage/logging/).

    **View results in the dashboard:**

    Once running, view your cost analytics in the [Reporter Dashboard](https://doc.log10x.com/roi-analytics/#edge-reporter).

??? tenx-delete "Step 9: Teardown"

    Nothing runs in the background — uninstall removes only what was installed.

    === ":simple-macos: Homebrew"

        ```bash
        brew uninstall --cask log10x && rm -rf /etc/tenx
        ```

    === ":simple-linux: Linux"

        ```bash
        sudo rm -rf /opt/tenx-edge /etc/tenx /etc/profile.d/tenx-edge.sh
        ```

        If installed via DEB: `sudo apt-get remove tenx-edge`
        If installed via RPM: `sudo yum remove tenx-edge`

    === ":material-microsoft-windows: Windows"

        Uninstall from **Settings > Apps > Installed apps**.

    === ":simple-docker: Docker"

        ```bash
        docker rmi log10x/pipeline-10x:latest
        ```

Compact specific patterns' events into a template+values tuple, without redeploying the engine.

The compact receiver makes a per-event decision whether to emit via `encode()` (the pattern's template hash plus extracted variable values, typically 20–40× smaller than the original line) or preserve `fullText`. The decision is keyed by pattern identity (the same symbolMessage the Reporter attributes cost to), so an operator targets compaction at the same patterns surfaced in cost analysis.

Entries live in a CSV cap-file, typically committed to a git repo and edited by PR. The file is hot-reloaded on in-place writes; a merged PR takes effect within ~10 seconds, no pod restart.

## :material-clipboard-list-outline: Per-pattern caps

A cap-file declares, for each pattern, whether its events are compacted or preserved. Patterns not listed fall back to `compactReceiverDefault`.

**File format**, CSV with a header row, keyed by the fields named in `compactReceiverFieldNames` joined with `_` (default: `[symbolMessage]`):

```csv
fieldSet,value
<fieldSet>,<true|false>[:<untilEpochSec>][:<reason>]
```

- `fieldSet`, the event fields named by `compactReceiverFieldNames` joined with `_`. With the default `[symbolMessage]` this is the symbolMessage value for the pattern.
- `value`, `true` compacts via `encode()`; `false` explicitly preserves `fullText` for this pattern (beats the default).
- `untilEpochSec`, optional Unix-epoch (seconds) expiry. Past it the entry self-heals and the pattern falls back to `compactReceiverDefault`.
- `reason`, optional free-text for audit. Must not contain commas (would break CSV parsing).

**Example** (with `compactReceiverDefault: false`):

```csv
fieldSet,value
payment_retry_gateway_timeout,true:1745856000:OPS-5123 spike
auth_audit_trail,false:1745856000:compliance keep verbose
```

The engine hot-reloads on in-place file writes (the gitops pattern); Kubernetes `ConfigMap` mounts don't reload because the CM swap is a symlink rename, not an in-place write.

## :material-swap-horizontal: Default policy

`compactReceiverDefault` sets the fallback decision when no cap-file entry matches:

- **`false`** (default), preserve `fullText`. Cap-file entries opt specific patterns *into* compaction. Right when most traffic is already high-signal.
- **`true`**, compact via `encode()`. Cap-file entries opt specific patterns *out* of compaction (e.g. audit/compliance patterns that must stay verbose). Right when most traffic is low-signal machinery and only a few patterns need full-text fidelity.

Flipping the default is a policy decision that affects every event and requires a pod rollout. Cap-file edits handle per-pattern exceptions without restart.

## :material-cog-box: Wiring

```yaml
compactReceiver:
  fieldNames: [symbolMessage]        # fields joined to form the lookup key
  default: false                     # fallback when no entry matches
  lookup:
    file: $=path("data/caps") + "/compact-cap.csv"
    retain: $=parseDuration("10m")
```

- Setting `lookup.file` enables the per-pattern compaction path; leaving it unset preserves the pre-compact behavior (receive-only emits `fullText`; `receiverOptimize=true` compacts every event).

Tune these values in this config block, not via container environment variables. Any `compactReceiver:` key set here resolves to a launch argument at engine init and shadows a same-named env var, so env-only overrides are silently ignored. Edit the config (via a gitops PR) to change a value at runtime.

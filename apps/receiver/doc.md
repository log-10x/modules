The Receiver runs alongside your log forwarder and acts on events as they flow through. It decides a per-pattern action for every pattern it sees: pass, sample, compact, tier_down, offload, or drop. An AI agent picks the action per service through the log10x MCP (the `configure_engine` tool); the engine enforces it, and the decision travels as a config change through the GitOps repo.

The actions:

- **pass**: forward unchanged.
- **sample**: forward a rate-limited share against a per-pattern budget.
- **compact**: replace repeated lines with an encoded form the destination expands (lossless only where the destination supports it: Splunk, self-hosted Elasticsearch, ClickHouse; a no-op elsewhere). Requires the expand plugin installed in [Splunk](compact/splunk.md) or [Elasticsearch](compact/elasticsearch.md).
- **tier_down**: tag the pattern for a cheaper storage tier the destination enforces (Datadog Flex, CloudWatch IA, Azure Monitor Basic/Auxiliary).
- **offload**: route the pattern to customer-owned object storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) instead of the destination.
- **drop**: stop forwarding the pattern.

The Receiver also runs in **read-only** mode (observation): receive events from the forwarder, run aggregators, and publish pattern-identity metrics with the event stream untouched. Use it for visibility into per-pattern volume and cost before any action is applied. **Read-write** mode (default) applies the per-pattern actions above.

Log10x is normally driven by an AI agent (Claude, or a model the customer brings) through the log10x MCP server, which installs, configures, and queries via MCP tools. The agent's `configure_engine` tool turns a target percent or budget into a per-pattern action set, carried as a cap/action CSV that lands in the config repo through a GitOps PR and hot-reloads on the next pull. The hand-authored cap YAML and CSV shown below are the same representation an agent produces.

<h3 id="compact">Compact action</h3>

The compact action replaces repeated lines with an encoded form the destination expands at query time, operating on stable pattern identity. It is lossless only on Splunk, self-hosted Elasticsearch, and ClickHouse, where it typically cuts log volume by 50-80%, and a no-op on managed/SaaS destinations (there the levers are offload or drop). For SIEM-side plugin install, see the [Splunk](compact/splunk.md) and [Elasticsearch](compact/elasticsearch.md) pages.

## :material-clipboard-play-outline: Setup Guide

Follow the steps below. Steps that require customization link to the relevant [Config Files](#config-files) section where you can edit on github.dev or locally.

???+ tenx-bootstrap "Step 1: Install"

    Install the engine on the same machine as your log forwarder. The script installs the [`Runtime`](https://doc.log10x.com/engine/flavors/#runtime) native binary; the DEB and RPM packages carry either the [`Compiler`](https://doc.log10x.com/engine/flavors/#compiler) or [`Runtime (JVM)`](https://doc.log10x.com/engine/flavors/#runtime-jvm). Windows has no native build, so the PowerShell script installs `Runtime (JVM)`:

    - :simple-linux: [Single line script](https://doc.log10x.com/install/singleline/ "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/log-10x/pipeline-releases/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --flavor runtime"){data-copy="curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/log-10x/pipeline-releases/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --flavor runtime"} | [DEB](https://doc.log10x.com/install/linux/#ubuntu-debian) | [RPM](https://doc.log10x.com/install/linux/#red-hat-centos-7)
    - :simple-macos: [Homebrew](https://doc.log10x.com/install/macos/ "brew install log-10x/tap/log10x"){data-copy="brew install log-10x/tap/log10x"}
    - :material-microsoft-windows: [PowerShell script](https://doc.log10x.com/install/win/)
    - :simple-docker: [Docker image](https://doc.log10x.com/install/docker/)

??? tenx-config "Step 2: Set Environment Variables"

    Set these environment variables before running. See [path configuration](https://doc.log10x.com/install/paths/) for details.

    | Variable | Description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | `TENX_MODULES` | Path to your [modules directory](https://doc.log10x.com/install/paths/#modules) |
    | `TENX_CONFIG` | Path to your [configuration directory](https://doc.log10x.com/install/paths/#config) |
    | `TENX_LICENSE_KEY` | Your Log10x license JWT ([download from console](https://console.log10x.com)) |

    ```bash
    export TENX_MODULES=/etc/tenx/modules
    export TENX_CONFIG=/etc/tenx/config
    export TENX_LICENSE_KEY="$(cat license.jwt)"
    ```

    For production deployments, mount the license as a file and set `TENX_LICENSE_FILE` instead. See [deploy](https://doc.log10x.com/apps/receiver/deploy/).

??? tenx-forwarderinputs "Step 3: Configure Your Forwarder"

    === ":simple-fluentd: Fluentd"

        **Step 1**: Include the 10x receiver configuration:

        ```toml title="my-fluentd.conf"
        # Nix/OSX
        @include "#{ENV['TENX_MODULES']}/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/fluentd/conf/tenx-receive-unix.conf"

        # Windows
        # @include "#{ENV['TENX_MODULES']}/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/fluentd/conf/tenx-receive-stdio.conf"
        ```

        **Step 2**: Apply the `@TENX` label to route events through the receiver:

        === "Route Start"

            Process events directly after reading from input (simplest setup):

            ```xml title="my-fluentd.conf"
            <source>
              @type tail
              path /path/to/file
              tag my_tag
              @label @TENX
            </source>
            ```

            Received events are marked with `@TENX-PROCESSED`. To re-apply `@ROOT`:

            ```toml
            @include "#{ENV['TENX_MODULES']}/pipelines/run/modules/forwarder/fluentd/conf/auxiliary/root.conf"
            ```

        === "Route End"

            Process events after all filters have been applied:

            ```xml title="my-fluentd.conf"
            <source>
              @type tail
              tag my_logs
            </source>

            <filter my_logs>
              @type filter1
            </filter>

            <filter my_logs>
              @type filter2
            </filter>

            <match my_logs>
              @type relabel
              @label @TENX
            </match>

            <label @TENX-PROCESSED>
              <match my_logs>
                @type stdout
              </match>
            </label>
            ```

        === "Mid-Route"

            Insert the receiver between specific plugins:

            ```xml title="my-fluentd.conf"
            <source>
              @type tail
              tag my_logs
            </source>

            <filter my_logs>
              @type filter1
            </filter>

            <match my_logs>
              @type relabel
              @label @TENX
            </match>

            <label @TENX-PROCESSED>
              <filter my_logs>
                @type filter2
              </filter>

              <match my_logs>
                @type stdout
              </match>
            </label>
            ```

        !!! note
            For large files or volume surges, set [XMX](https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-parameters#explicit-heap-memory---xms-and-xmx-options) or use [read_bytes_limit_per_second](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail#read_bytes_limit_per_second).

    === ":simple-fluentbit: Fluent-bit"

        !!! note "Sidecar topology"
            Fluent Bit and Log10x run as **peer processes** that exchange events over the Fluent Forward protocol in both directions. No Lua filter, no `io.popen()` subprocess. The bypass (preventing the ingest filters from re-firing and the ingest `[OUTPUT] forward` from looping events) is **tag-prefix namespacing**. Fluent Bit has no labels like Fluentd, so the egress `[INPUT] forward` uses `Tag_Prefix tenx.` to put returning events on a tag namespace that the ingest pipeline doesn't match.

        **Step 1**: Copy the Fluent Bit sidecar recipe:

        ```bash
        cp $TENX_MODULES/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/fluentbit/conf/tenx-sidecar.conf /etc/fluent-bit/
        ```

        **Step 2**: Update sources, filters and destination outputs to match your environment. The recipe wires the ingest `[OUTPUT] forward` to log10x:24224 (matching your source tags) and the egress `[INPUT] forward` listening on :24225 with `Tag_Prefix tenx.`, your destinations match `tenx.*`:

        ```toml title="tenx-sidecar.conf"
        [SERVICE]
            Flush        1
            Log_Level    info

        # Replace with your real sources, tag with anything NOT starting
        # with `tenx.` so the bypass works.
        [INPUT]
            Name         tail
            Path         /var/log/app.log
            Tag          app.logs
            Parser       json

        # Enrichment filters Match the user-tag scheme only (NOT `*`).
        [FILTER]
            Name         modify
            Match        app.*
            Add          cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME}

        # Ingest: hand off to the Log10x sidecar.
        [OUTPUT]
            Name         forward
            Match        app.*
            Host         127.0.0.1
            Port         24224
            Retry_Limit  False

        # Egress: receive processed events back from Log10x. `Tag_Prefix
        # tenx.` is the bypass, `app.logs` returns as `tenx.app.logs`,
        # which filters and the ingest forward output don't match.
        [INPUT]
            Name         forward
            Listen       0.0.0.0
            Port         24225
            Tag_Prefix   tenx.

        # Destinations Match `tenx.*`, replace stdout with your real
        # destination (es, splunk, kafka, s3, …).
        [OUTPUT]
            Name         stdout
            Match        tenx.*
            Format       json_lines
        ```

        **Step 3**: Start Log10x first so the Forward port is listening, then Fluent Bit:

        ```bash
        tenx run @run/input/forwarder/fluentbit @apps/receiver
        fluent-bit -c /etc/fluent-bit/tenx-sidecar.conf
        ```

        Two structurally separate stages prevent loops and double-enrichment: ingest filters/output match `app.*` only, destination outputs match `tenx.*` only. The original tag survives the round trip as the suffix of the prefixed tag (`tenx.app.logs`), so destinations that route on the suffix behave the same as without Log10x in the path.

    === ":simple-beats: Filebeat"

        **Step 1**: Add the 10x input for receiving filtered events:

        ```yaml title="my-filebeat.yml"
        filebeat.config.inputs:
          enabled: true
          # Nix/OSX
          path: ${TENX_MODULES}/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/filebeat/conf/tenxNix.yml
          # Windows
          # path: ${TENX_MODULES}/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/filebeat/conf/tenxWin.yml
        ```

        **Step 2**: Add the receiver processor:

        ```yaml title="my-filebeat.yml"
        filebeat.inputs:
          - type: filestream
            id: my-filestream-id
            paths:
              - /path/to/log

            processors:
              - script:
                  lang: javascript
                  file: ${TENX_MODULES}/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/filebeat/script/tenx-receive.js
        ```

    === ":simple-logstash: Logstash"

        Set up [multiple pipelines](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/multiple-pipelines.html) in `pipelines.yml`:

        ```yaml title="pipelines.yml"
        - pipeline.id: raw_input
          path.config: "/path/to/conf/upstream.conf"
        - pipeline.id: tenx_pipeline
          path.config: "${TENX_CONFIG}/pipelines/run/input/forwarder/logstash/receive/tenx-pipe-out.conf"
        - pipeline.id: tenx_unix_pipeline
          path.config: "${TENX_CONFIG}/pipelines/run/input/forwarder/logstash/receive/tenx-pipe-in-unix.conf"
        - pipeline.id: processed
          path.config: "/path/to/conf/downstream.conf"
        ```

        ```ruby title="upstream.conf"
        input {
          file { path => /path/to/log }
        }
        output {
          pipeline { send_to => tenx_input_pipeline }
        }
        ```

        ```ruby title="downstream.conf"
        input {
          pipeline { address => user_output_pipeline }
        }
        output {
          stdout { codec => json }
        }
        ```

    === ":simple-opentelemetry: OTel Collector"

        !!! note "Distribution"
            Both directions use OTLP/gRPC (Collector → Log10x and Log10x → Collector), so the core `otelcol` distribution is sufficient. No `otelcol-contrib` build is required. Tested against `otelcol` v0.151.0+.

        **Step 1**: Copy the Collector sidecar recipe:

        ```bash
        cp $TENX_MODULES/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/otel-collector/conf/tenx-sidecar.yaml /etc/otelcol/
        ```

        **Step 2**: Update receivers and destination exporters to match your environment. The `logs/to-tenx` pipeline carries your receivers and enrichment processors through the `otlp/tenx` exporter; the `logs/from-tenx` pipeline carries returning events directly to your destination exporters:

        ```yaml title="tenx-sidecar.yaml"
        receivers:
          # Replace with your real Collector receivers
          filelog:
            include:
              - /var/log/**/*.log
            start_at: end

        exporters:
          # Replace `debug` with your real destinations, elasticsearch, splunk_hec, kafka, awss3, etc.
          debug:
            verbosity: detailed

        service:
          pipelines:
            logs/to-tenx:
              receivers: [filelog]
              processors: [batch]
              exporters: [otlp/tenx]
            logs/from-tenx:
              receivers: [otlp/tenx]
              exporters: [debug]
        ```

        **Step 3**: Start Log10x first so the OTLP/gRPC port is listening, then the Collector:

        ```bash
        tenx run @run/input/forwarder/otel-collector @apps/receiver
        otelcol --config=/etc/otelcol/tenx-sidecar.yaml
        ```

        Keep the egress pipeline (`logs/from-tenx`) processor-free, it carries returning events directly to your destination exporters so enrichment runs exactly once.

    === ":simple-vector: Vector"

        !!! note "Requires Vector v0.34+"
            For the `fluent` source and `socket` sink with `mode: unix`. Vector communicates with the 10x sidecar over Unix domain sockets, newline-delimited text outbound, Fluent Forward inbound.

        **Step 1**: Copy the Vector configuration:

        ```bash
        cp $TENX_MODULES/pipelines/run/modules/input/forwarder/vector/receive/tenxNix.yaml /etc/vector/
        ```

        **Step 2**: Update sources and final sinks to match your environment:

        ```yaml title="tenxNix.yaml"
        sources:
          # Replace with your real Vector sources
          app_logs:
            type: file
            include:
              - /var/log/**/*.log
            read_from: end

        sinks:
          # Replace `console` with your real destination(s), elasticsearch, splunk_hec, kafka, s3, etc.
          final:
            type: console
            inputs:
              - tenx_out
            encoding:
              codec: json
        ```

        **Step 3**: Start Log10x first, then Vector:

        ```bash
        tenx run @run/input/forwarder/vector/receive @apps/receiver
        vector --config /etc/vector/tenxNix.yaml
        ```

        Two disconnected component chains in Vector's graph prevent loops: `app_logs → tenx_in` (events out to 10x) and `tenx_out → final` (received events in from 10x) never wire together.

    === ":simple-splunk: Splunk UF"

        !!! note "File Relay Pattern"
            This integration uses a **file relay pattern**: Fluent Bit + 10x reads from Folder A, receives events, and writes to Folder B. Splunk UF monitors Folder B and handles forwarding to Splunk indexers.

        **Step 1**: Set up folder paths:

        ```bash
        export FOLDER_A=/var/log/app        # App writes here
        export FOLDER_B=/var/log/processed  # UF reads from here
        mkdir -p ${FOLDER_B}
        ```

        **Step 2**: Configure Fluent Bit to read from Folder A, hand off to log10x, and write the processed events back out to Folder B. The egress `[INPUT] forward Tag_Prefix tenx.` is the bypass, only events that have round-tripped through log10x (and thus carry the `tenx.` prefix) hit the `file` output.

        ```toml title="fluent-bit-splunk.conf"
        [SERVICE]
            Flush        1
            Log_Level    info

        [INPUT]
            Name         tail
            Path         ${FOLDER_A}/*.log
            Tag          app.logs

        # Ingest: hand off to the Log10x sidecar.
        [OUTPUT]
            Name         forward
            Match        app.*
            Host         127.0.0.1
            Port         24224
            Retry_Limit  False

        # Egress: receive processed events back from Log10x with Tag_Prefix
        # bypass. `app.logs` returns as `tenx.app.logs`.
        [INPUT]
            Name         forward
            Listen       0.0.0.0
            Port         24225
            Tag_Prefix   tenx.

        # Write processed events (those with the tenx. prefix only) to Folder B.
        [OUTPUT]
            Name         file
            Match        tenx.*
            Path         ${FOLDER_B}
            Format       plain
        ```

        Start log10x first, then fluent-bit: `tenx run @run/input/forwarder/fluentbit @apps/receiver && fluent-bit -c fluent-bit-splunk.conf`.

        **Step 3**: Configure Splunk UF to monitor Folder B:

        ```ini title="inputs.conf"
        [monitor://${FOLDER_B}]
        index = main
        sourcetype = app_logs
        ```

        This keeps Splunk UF as the forwarder (handling buffering, retries, timeouts) while 10x receives events inline. See the [Splunk UF module](https://doc.log10x.com/run/input/forwarder/splunkUF/) for details.

    === ":simple-datadog: Datadog Agent"

        !!! note "File Relay Pattern"
            This integration uses a **file relay pattern**: Fluent Bit + 10x reads from Folder A, receives events, and writes to Folder B. Datadog Agent monitors Folder B and handles forwarding to Datadog.

        **Step 1**: Set up folder paths:

        ```bash
        export FOLDER_A=/var/log/app        # App writes here
        export FOLDER_B=/var/log/processed  # DD Agent reads from here
        mkdir -p ${FOLDER_B}
        ```

        **Step 2**: Configure Fluent Bit to read from Folder A, hand off to log10x, and write the processed events back out to Folder B. The egress `[INPUT] forward Tag_Prefix tenx.` is the bypass, only events that have round-tripped through log10x (and thus carry the `tenx.` prefix) hit the `file` output.

        ```toml title="fluent-bit-datadog.conf"

        # Egress: receive processed events back from Log10x with Tag_Prefix
        # bypass. `app.logs` returns as `tenx.app.logs`.
        [INPUT]

            Tag_Prefix   tenx.

        # Write processed events (those with the tenx. prefix only) to Folder B.
        [OUTPUT]
            Name         file
            Match        tenx.*
            Path         ${FOLDER_B}
            Format       plain
        ```

        Start log10x first, then fluent-bit: `tenx run @run/input/forwarder/fluentbit @apps/receiver && fluent-bit -c fluent-bit-datadog.conf`.

        **Step 3**: Configure Datadog Agent to monitor Folder B:

        ```yaml title="conf.d/tenx.d/conf.yaml"
        logs:
          - type: file
            path: ${FOLDER_B}/*.log
            service: myapp
            source: myapp
        ```

        This keeps Datadog Agent as the forwarder (handling buffering, retries, metadata enrichment) while 10x receives events inline. See the [Datadog Agent module](https://doc.log10x.com/run/input/forwarder/datadogAgent/) for details.

    === ":material-test-tube: Test (no forwarder)"

        Test the receiver without setting up a forwarder using the [Dev CLI](https://doc.log10x.com/apps/dev/).

        The dev app uses the [file input module](https://doc.log10x.com/run/input/file/) to read sample log files and writes output to a file, allowing you to verify receiving behavior before integrating with your forwarder.

        **No forwarder configuration required** - provide sample log files to the file input module and skip to [Step 9](#__tabbed_6_5) to run the test.

??? tenx-symbols "Step 4: Symbol Library (optional)"

    Load custom [Symbol library](https://doc.log10x.com/compile/) files to transform events into typed TenXObjects.

    Place symbol files in the `symbolPaths` folders specified in the [symbol config](#symbols).

<span id="pair-with-retriever"></span>
??? tenx-integration "Step 5: Pair with Retriever (optional)"

    Archive all events to S3 before receiving for full retention alongside cost control. The receiver filters what reaches your SIEM; filtered events remain in S3, queryable via [Retriever](https://doc.log10x.com/apps/retriever/) for incident investigation, compliance, and auditing.

    Configure your forwarder to duplicate the event stream, one copy to S3 (all events), one through the receiver (filtered events to SIEM):

    === ":simple-fluentbit: Fluent-bit"

        Use the `rewrite_tag` filter to duplicate events onto an `s3.*` tag before they hit the ingest `[OUTPUT] forward` to the 10x sidecar:

        ```ini
        [FILTER]
            Name         rewrite_tag
            Match        app.*
            Rule         $log .+ s3.$TAG true

        # S3 archive: gets every event (`app.*` originals AND their `s3.app.*` copies
        # adjust the rule above if you want only the copies).
        [OUTPUT]
            Name         s3
            Match        s3.*
            bucket       your-archive-bucket
            region       us-east-1
            total_file_size 50M
            upload_timeout 60s

        # Ingest: hand off to the Log10x sidecar (processed path).
        [OUTPUT]
            Name         forward
            Match        app.*
            Host         127.0.0.1
            Port         24224
            Retry_Limit  False
        ```

        Events tagged `s3.*` go to S3 (every event for full retention); events tagged `app.*` continue through the sidecar (processed). The egress `[INPUT] forward Tag_Prefix tenx.` and destinations matching `tenx.*` are unchanged from the main recipe.

    === ":simple-fluentd: Fluentd"

        Use the `copy` output plugin to send events to both S3 and the 10x sidecar:

        ```xml
        <match app.**>
          @type copy
          <store>
            @type s3
            s3_bucket your-archive-bucket
            s3_region us-east-1
            path logs/
            <buffer time>
              timekey 3600
              timekey_wait 10m
            </buffer>
          </store>
          <store>
            @type forward
            # → 10x sidecar
          </store>
        </match>
        ```

    === ":simple-opentelemetry: OTel Collector"

        Fan out to the Retriever destination from the **ingest** pipeline (before 10x receives), so the archive sees full-volume events. The destinations that consume the **egress** pipeline (`logs/from-tenx`) get the receiver-processed stream:

        ```yaml
        exporters:
          awss3:
            s3uploader:
              region: us-east-1
              s3_bucket: your-archive-bucket
          # → 10x sidecar processes and receives, results land on logs/from-tenx
          otlp/tenx:
            endpoint: 127.0.0.1:4317
            tls:
              insecure: true

        service:
          pipelines:
            logs/to-tenx:
              receivers: [filelog]
              processors: [batch]
              # Full-volume fanout: archive + 10x sidecar
              exporters: [awss3, otlp/tenx]
            logs/from-tenx:
              receivers: [otlp/tenx]
              exporters: [otlp/siem]   # receiver-processed stream
        ```

    === ":simple-logstash: Logstash"

        Use multiple outputs. Logstash natively sends to all configured outputs:

        ```ruby
        output {
          s3 {
            bucket => "your-archive-bucket"
            region => "us-east-1"
            size_file => 52428800
            time_file => 60
          }
          pipe {
            command => "/opt/tenx-edge/bin/tenx run ..."
            # → 10x sidecar processes and receives these events
          }
        }
        ```

    === ":simple-splunk: Splunk UF"

        Splunk UF uses a [file relay pattern](https://doc.log10x.com/run/input/forwarder/splunkUF/). Fluent Bit + 10x reads from Folder A, processes events, and writes to Folder B. Splunk UF monitors Folder B and forwards to indexers.

        Add the S3 output to the Fluent Bit configuration alongside the file output:

        ```ini
        [FILTER]
            Name         rewrite_tag
            Match        app.*
            Rule         $log .+ s3.$TAG true

        [OUTPUT]
            Name         s3
            Match        s3.*
            bucket       your-archive-bucket
            region       us-east-1
            total_file_size 50M
            upload_timeout 60s

        # Received events written to Folder B for Splunk UF
        [OUTPUT]
            Name         file
            Match        *
            Path         ${FOLDER_B}
            Format       plain
        ```

        Splunk UF continues to monitor Folder B via `inputs.conf`. No changes to the UF configuration.

    === ":simple-datadog: Datadog Agent"

        Datadog Agent uses a [file relay pattern](https://doc.log10x.com/run/input/forwarder/datadogAgent/). Fluent Bit + 10x reads from Folder A, processes events, and writes to Folder B. The Datadog Agent monitors Folder B and forwards to Datadog.

        Add the S3 output to the Fluent Bit configuration alongside the file output:

        ```ini
        [FILTER]
            Name         rewrite_tag
            Match        app.*
            Rule         $log .+ s3.$TAG true

        [OUTPUT]
            Name         s3
            Match        s3.*
            bucket       your-archive-bucket
            region       us-east-1
            total_file_size 50M
            upload_timeout 60s

        # Received events written to Folder B for Datadog Agent
        [OUTPUT]
            Name         file
            Match        *
            Path         ${FOLDER_B}
            Format       plain
        ```

        The Datadog Agent continues to monitor Folder B via `conf.d`. No changes to the Agent configuration.

<span id="receivers2"></span>
??? tenx-receivers "Step 6: Configure Receivers (optional)"

    Configure [rate receivers](https://doc.log10x.com/run/receive/rate/) for common scenarios. Edit these settings in your receiver [config.yaml](#receivers).

    === ":material-percent: Per-Pattern Cap"

        Cap any single log pattern at 20% of its container's volume. The [Level Classifier](https://doc.log10x.com/run/initialize/level/) enriches events with severity, so the floor keeps ERROR events flowing even when a pattern is over its cap.

        ```yaml
        rateReceiver:
          fieldNames:
            - symbolMessage              # the pattern identity
          containerField: container      # scopes the share denominator
          maxSharePerFieldSet: 0.2       # no pattern exceeds 20% of its container
          severityFloors:
            - INFO=0.1
            - WARN=0.3
            - ERROR=0.5
        ```

        The floor beats the cap: a pattern over 20% still keeps Error 50%, Warn 30%, Info 10%. At or below the cap every event passes through untouched.

    === ":material-kubernetes: Multi-App Kubernetes"

        Cap each pattern per app, scoped by container so all of an app's replicas share one cap. The [container name](https://doc.log10x.com/run/initialize/k8s/) stays constant across pods.

        ```yaml
        rateReceiver:
          fieldNames:
            - symbolMessage
          containerField: container      # same name across all pod replicas
        ```

        Each (pattern, container) pair gets its own 20% cap. Scaling from 1 to 10 pods does not bypass it because the container name is stable across replicas.

    === ":material-file-document-edit-outline: Mute File (GitOps)"

        Layer a declarative mute file over the rate receiver, pulled from a git repo. Entries are keyed by the same `fieldNames` values the rate receiver uses (e.g. `symbolMessage`), so mutes target the same patterns a Reporter attributes cost to. A listed, active pattern is decided by its entry; every other pattern stays on the cap. Each entry has an explicit sample rate and epoch expiry, so mutes are diff-reviewed, audited, and self-healing.

        ```yaml
        rateReceiver:
          fieldNames:
            - symbolMessage
          lookup:
            file: /etc/log10x/config/data/sample/mutes/mutes.csv
            retain: 300000                 # mark stale after 5 minutes
        ```

        Entries in `mutes.csv` look like `Error_syncing_pod=0.10:1744848000:pod error spam OPS-4821`. See [protection list](https://doc.log10x.com/run/receive/rate/#protection-list) for the format and workflow.

??? tenx-initializers "Step 7: Enrichments (optional)"

    Enrichments add context (severity, HTTP codes) for richer aggregation and filtering.

    **To enable:**

    1. In the [app config](#mainConfig), uncomment the desired enrichment `include` entries
    2. In the [initializers](#initializers) section below, configure each enrichment's settings

??? tenx-metricoutputs "Step 8: Metrics Output (optional)"

    Publish [aggregated](https://doc.log10x.com/run/aggregate/) metrics to time-series databases (Prometheus, Datadog).

    **To enable:**

    1. In the [app config](#mainConfig), uncomment the desired metric output `include` entry
    2. In the [metric outputs](#metricOutputs) section below, configure connection details

??? tenx-mainconfig "Step 9: Run"

    Start your forwarder with the updated configuration:

    === ":simple-fluentd: Fluentd"

        ```console
        $ fluentd -c my-fluentd.conf
        ```

    === ":simple-fluentbit: Fluent-bit"

        Start Log10x first so its Forward port is listening when Fluent Bit starts, then start Fluent Bit:

        ```console
        $ tenx run @run/input/forwarder/fluentbit @apps/receiver
        $ fluent-bit -c /etc/fluent-bit/tenx-sidecar.conf
        ```

    === ":simple-beats: Filebeat"

        ```console title="Nix/OSX"
        $ filebeat -c my-filebeat.yml -e 2>&1 | /opt/tenx-edge/bin/tenx run @run/input/forwarder/filebeat @apps/receiver
        ```

        ```console title="Windows"
        $ filebeat -c my-filebeat.yml -e 2>&1 | "c:\program files\tenx-edge\tenx" run @run/input/forwarder/filebeat @apps/receiver
        ```

    === ":simple-logstash: Logstash"

        ```console
        $ logstash -f my-logstash.conf
        ```

    === ":simple-opentelemetry: OTel Collector"

        Start Log10x first so its OTLP/gRPC port is listening when the Collector starts, then start the Collector:

        ```console
        $ tenx run @run/input/forwarder/otel-collector @apps/receiver
        $ otelcol --config=/etc/otelcol/tenx-sidecar.yaml
        ```

    === ":simple-splunk: Splunk UF"

        **Step 1**: Start Log10x first, then Fluent Bit:

        ```console
        $ tenx run @run/input/forwarder/fluentbit @apps/receiver
        $ fluent-bit -c fluent-bit-splunk.conf
        ```

        **Step 2**: Start (or restart) Splunk UF to pick up Folder B:

        ```console
        $ splunk restart
        ```

        Fluent Bit reads from Folder A, hands off to the Log10x sidecar, and writes processed events back out to Folder B. Splunk UF monitors Folder B and forwards to indexers.

    === ":simple-datadog: Datadog Agent"

        **Step 1**: Start Log10x first, then Fluent Bit:

        ```console
        $ tenx run @run/input/forwarder/fluentbit @apps/receiver
        $ fluent-bit -c fluent-bit-datadog.conf
        ```

        **Step 2**: Start (or restart) the Datadog Agent to pick up Folder B:

        ```console
        $ sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent
        ```

        Fluent Bit reads from Folder A, hands off to the Log10x sidecar, and writes processed events back out to Folder B. Datadog Agent monitors Folder B and forwards to Datadog.

    === ":material-test-tube: Test (no forwarder)"

        Use the [Dev CLI](https://doc.log10x.com/apps/dev/) to test event processing with sample log files.

        **Step 1**: Provide sample log files to the [file input module](https://doc.log10x.com/run/input/file/):

        ```console
        $ cp /path/to/sample.log $TENX_CONFIG/data/sample/input/
        ```

        **Step 2**: Run the dev app:

        ```console
        $ tenx run @apps/dev
        ```

        The dev app reads events from `data/sample/input/*.log` via the file input module, processes them through the receiving pipeline, and writes results to the configured [file output](https://doc.log10x.com/run/output/event/file/).

        **Verify output:**

        ```console
        $ wc -l $TENX_CONFIG/data/sample/output/encoded.log
        ```

        Compare input vs output line counts to verify event processing.

??? tenx-checklist "Step 10: Verify"

    Verify no errors appear in the [log file](https://doc.log10x.com/manage/logging/#log-file-location). For debugging techniques including enabling verbose logging, see [Engine Logging](https://doc.log10x.com/manage/logging/).

    **View results in the dashboard:**

    Once running, view your cost analytics in the [Receiver Dashboard](https://doc.log10x.com/roi-analytics/#edge-receiver).

Extracts [symbol](https://doc.log10x.com/run/transform/structure/#symbols) values from text/binary files using plain text tokenization or [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) parsers.

Parses input by splitting lines with delimiters or using a [JsonFactory](https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-core/javadoc/2.8/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonFactory.html) for structured token reading.

When source code for a log format is unavailable (e.g., third-party services), scan a sample log to extract symbols for future parsing.

!!! note "Size limit"

    Files over 50KB are skipped to avoid slow parsing of machine-generated content.
